# Renewable Energy Generation Forcast

<h2 align="center">Solar Energy Generation Forecast</h2>

### 1. Introduction
We focus on forecasting solar energy generation using historical data. We preprocess the data and apply machine learning models to predict energy output.

- **The Notebook and Dataset:**
  - [Solar Energy Generation Forecast](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/blob/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20energy%20generation%20forecast.ipynb)
  - [Dataset](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/tree/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Dataset)

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
We load time-series data from CSV files and perform:
- **Missing Value Handling:** Interpolation and forward-fill.
- **Feature Engineering:** Adding time-based features like hour and day.
- **Scaling:** Using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
- **Data Splitting:** Training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We analyze trends, distributions, and relationships using:
- Time-series plots, correlation matrices, histograms, and boxplots.

### 4. Model Selection and Implementation
We experiment with:
- **Linear Regression:** As a baseline model.
- **Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors:** For capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM):** For advanced, iterative improvements.
- **Neural Networks (if applicable):** For modeling complex patterns.

We tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
We use:
- **MAE:** To measure average prediction errors.
- **RMSE:** To penalize larger errors.
- **RÂ²:** To explain variance captured by the model.

### 6. Model Training and Validation
We apply cross-validation and plot learning/validation curves to monitor performance and diagnose overfitting.

### 7. Forecasting and Results Visualization
We predict solar energy generation using the best model and compare predictions against actual data using time-series plots and residual plots.

<h2 align="center">Wind Energy Generation Forecast</h2>

### 1. Introduction
We focus on predicting wind energy generation using historical data. Our approach involves preprocessing the data and applying time-series forecasting models like ARIMA to predict wind energy output for the next 15 days.

- **The Notebook and Dataset:**
  - [Wind Energy Generation Forecast](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/blob/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Wind%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Wind%20energy%20generation%20forecast.ipynb)
  - [Dataset](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/tree/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Wind%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Dataset)

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
We load time-series data from CSV files containing information on wind turbine power generation. The preprocessing steps include:
- **Handling Missing Data:** Dealing with missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generating time-lagged features to improve model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Using scatter plots and histograms to explore data distribution.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We visualize trends and correlations within the dataset:
- **Time-Series Visualization:** Plotting active power generation over time.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Checking relationships between lagged values and current power output.

### 4. Model Selection and Implementation
We implement and evaluate ARIMA for time-series forecasting:
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Configured with optimal parameters `(p=2, d=0, q=3)` after tuning.
- **Model Diagnostics:** Analyzing residuals for normality and autocorrelation.
- **Train-Test Split:** Splitting the data to validate model performance over a 15-day forecast.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
We use key metrics to evaluate forecast accuracy:
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** ~2.6% indicating 97.4% accuracy.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** For evaluating model precision.

### 6. Model Training and Validation
We train the ARIMA model on historical data and validate its performance using test data. We plot the actual vs. predicted values and confidence intervals to evaluate the accuracy visually.

### 7. Forecasting and Results Visualization
The final model is used to predict wind energy generation for the next 15 days. We visualize the forecast against actual values, displaying prediction intervals and residual errors.
