# Renewable Energy Generation Forcast

## Solar Energy Generation Forecast

### 1. Introduction
We focus on forecasting solar energy generation using historical data. We preprocess the data and apply machine learning models to predict energy output.

- **The Notebooks and Dataset:**
  - [Solar Energy Generation Forecast](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/blob/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20energy%20generation%20forecast.ipynb)
  - [Dataset](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/tree/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Dataset)

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
We load time-series data from CSV files and perform:
- **Missing Value Handling:** Interpolation and forward-fill.
- **Feature Engineering:** Adding time-based features like hour and day.
- **Scaling:** Using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
- **Data Splitting:** Training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We analyze trends, distributions, and relationships using:
- Time-series plots, correlation matrices, histograms, and boxplots.

### 4. Model Selection and Implementation
We experiment with:
- **Linear Regression:** As a baseline model.
- **Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors:** For capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM):** For advanced, iterative improvements.
- **Neural Networks (if applicable):** For modeling complex patterns.

We tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
We use:
- **MAE:** To measure average prediction errors.
- **RMSE:** To penalize larger errors.
- **RÂ²:** To explain variance captured by the model.

### 6. Model Training and Validation
We apply cross-validation and plot learning/validation curves to monitor performance and diagnose overfitting.

### 7. Forecasting and Results Visualization
We predict solar energy generation using the best model and compare predictions against actual data using time-series plots and residual plots.
