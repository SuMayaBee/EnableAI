# Renewable Energy Generation Forecast

## Solar Energy Generation Forecast

### 1. Introduction
We focus on forecasting solar energy generation based on historical data. We apply various data preprocessing steps and machine learning models to predict future energy output.

- **The Notebooks and Dataset:**
  - [Solar Energy Generation Forecast](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/blob/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20energy%20generation%20forecast.ipynb)
  - [Dataset](https://github.com/SuMayaBee/RenewAble-Synergy/tree/main/Renewable%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Solar%20Energy%20Generation%20Forecast/Dataset)

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

**Libraries Used:**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: For data visualization.

**Data Loading:**
We load the dataset from CSV files, which contain time-series data related to solar energy generation, weather conditions, or other relevant features.

**Preprocessing:**
- We handle missing values using methods like interpolation or forward-fill.
- We perform feature engineering, creating time-based features such as the hour of the day and day of the week.
- We apply scaling and normalization techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
- We split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** We aim to understand the data distribution, trends, and relationships between features.

**Techniques Used:**
- We use time-series plots to visualize solar generation trends over time.
- We create correlation matrices to identify relationships between features.
- We analyze the distribution of key variables using histograms and boxplots.

### 4. Model Selection and Implementation
We explore multiple machine learning models for time-series forecasting:

- **Linear Regression:**  
  A simple baseline model to predict solar generation based on selected features.
- **Decision Tree Regressor:**  
  A non-linear model to capture complex relationships in the data.
- **Random Forest Regressor:**  
  An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and generalization.
- **Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):**  
  Advanced boosting techniques that iteratively improve the model by focusing on errors from previous iterations.
- **Neural Networks (if applicable):**  
  A deep learning approach using fully connected layers to model complex patterns.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
We use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters, ensuring the best performance.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
We use common metrics such as:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** A more penalizing metric for larger errors.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Explains the variance in the dependent variable captured by the model.

### 6. Model Training and Validation
We apply cross-validation techniques to assess model performance across different folds, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. We also plot learning curves and validation curves to diagnose overfitting or underfitting.

### 7. Forecasting and Results Visualization
We use the final model to predict future solar energy generation. We plot the predictions against actual data to visually inspect model accuracy. Additionally, we employ time-series plots, scatter plots, and residual plots to showcase the performance of the chosen model.
